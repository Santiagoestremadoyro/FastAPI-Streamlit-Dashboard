# Mid-Bootcamp Project: Creating an API and Dashboard

# Description
In this project, i created an API to serve data from a penguin dataset that was enriched with data obtained from another Data Base. I designed the API with multiple endpoints that used various parameters to allow for different types of requests. Such as returning only penguins of a particular species or even searching for a specific penguin with its "Individual ID".


Also created a Streamlit dashboard to visualize the data obtained from the API. The dashboard allowed for interactive visualizations, and i used different streamlit widgets to allow for user interaction with the visualizations. I have also been able to add functionalities to be able to create a user and add it to the database, for later verification so that users are not repeated. Also in the same dashboard you can have contact via email for the user.

Before creating the API and dashboard, i cleaned and formatted the penguin dataset, eliminating penguins with missing values in multiple columns. Also used the available data to determine the sex of some of the penguins that had missing values in the sex column.

## Dataset
I used the Palmer Archipelago Penguins dataset, which contained information on the body size, sex, survival, etc of Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.
The database provides a lot of data about each of the penguins, which allows us to create features in the dashboard that allow us to do a more in-depth monitoring of each of these subjects.
I stored the cleaned and formatted dataset in a MongoDB dataset, organized in collections.

## Data Preparation
I cleaned and formatted the dataset by eliminating penguins with missing values in multiple columns using a query: 
```python
   {$or: [{culmen_length_mm: "NA"}, {culmen_depth_mm: "NA"}, {flipper_length_mm: "NA"}, {body_mass_g: "NA"}, {sex: "NA"}] }
```

I also determined the sex of some of the penguins using the available data.

üêß Males are just bigger. They weigh from 4 to 5 kg and measure 45 cm. They have longer and broader beaks and a more pronounced forehead.


## API
I designed an API, using Fastapi, that used different endpoints to serve data from the database to later view it in Streamlit. I used various parameters to allow for different types of requests, such as filtering by species, sex, or islan, separating by their "Individual ID".

```python
   @router.get("/all/pinguins/specie")
def get_pinguins_s():
    result = db["pinguinos"].aggregate([
        {"$match":{"species": {"$ne":None}}},
        {"$group": {"_id": "$species", "count": {"$sum": 1}}}
    ])
    return res(result)

@router.get("/all/pinguins/islan")
def get_pinguins_i():
    result = db["pinguinos"].aggregate([
        {"$match":{"island": {"$ne":None}}},
        {"$group": {"_id": "$island", "count": {"$sum": 1}}}
    ])
    return res(result)
```

## Dashboard
I created a Streamlit dashboard that visualized the data obtained from the API. The dashboard included interactive visualizations that allowed for user interaction. I used different streamlit widgets to allow for user interaction with the visualizations, creation of a user, possibility of communication through email, etc.

# Conclusion
This project has allowed me to practice all the knowledge acquired, throughout this time such as Python (creation of APIs and connection to database), HTML, Mongo DB Compass, Postman, Streamlit and explore a problem on my own in the search for solutions.
